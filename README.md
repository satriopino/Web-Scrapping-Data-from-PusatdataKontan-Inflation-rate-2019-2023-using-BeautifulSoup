# Web-Scrapping-Data-from-PusatdataKontan-Inflation-rate-2019-2023-using-BeautifulSoup
Collected Open Source data (Open source Website) regarding the Inflation Rate using BeautifulSoup Library

## Background
In this project, we try to scrap Inflation rate data from **https://pusatdata.kontan.co.id/** data center website. "https://pusatdata.kontan.co.id/" is a financial and market data portal that provides access to various financial data, market analysis, and related information. The website offers up-to-date news, data, and analysis on various topics such as investments, national and international markets, finance, and economics. It also provides information on interest rates, exchange rates, and stock prices. The website appears to be a reliable source of financial and market data for investors, traders, and anyone interested in financial news and analysis. We will try to scrap these sites for educational purposes only.

A lot of you might ask why we need to scrap this data from the sites while it already has a good enough visualization. Let's say we have a task to make a forecast on the Inflation rate. To do that we need to have the data, and scrapping is a good way to collect the data we don't have from the public.

We will scrap 5 points from this site. That is **Date, Inflation value MoM, and Inflation value YoY**. In this case, we will go to the Kontan data center Inflation rate page, you can click [here] (https://pusatdata.kontan.co.id/makroekonomi/inflasi) to follow what exactly that link goes to.
